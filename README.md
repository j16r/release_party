# Release Party - Celebrate Successful Deployments

Release party is a simple Capistrano plugin, which takes some configurable actions when you've successfully deployed your project. These might include:

* Send out a deployment notice by email
* Mark finished features as delivered in Pivotal Tracker
* Announce delivery using campfile

## Configuring

Create a 'Releasefile' in your project root to control what actions are taken when a deploy succeeds.

## Contributing

We encourage all community contributions. Keeping this in mind, please follow these general guidelines when contributing:

* Fork the project
* Create a topic branch for what you’re working on (git checkout -b awesome_feature)
* Commit away, push that up (git push your\_remote awesome\_feature)
* Create a new GitHub Issue with the commit, asking for review. Alternatively, send a pull request with details of what you added.
* Once it’s accepted, if you want access to the core repository feel free to ask! Otherwise, you can continue to hack away in your own fork.

Other than that, our guidelines very closely match the GemCutter guidelines [here](http://wiki.github.com/qrush/gemcutter/contribution-guidelines).
